## Usage

To use the Single layer perceptron neural network implementation and the GUI, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `python main.py` to launch the GUI

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of the Single layer perceptron neural network algorithm is based on the work of Frank Rosenblatt, and the GUI is built using the tkinter library.
